# Discord-Music-Bot-via-Pytube
A simple Discord bot that plays music from YouTube in the voice channels. 

This bot is in very early development, so any help is greatly appreciated. 

I'd you want to try the bot out yourself, you need to download python, pytube, ffmpeg, and the main.py file. After you have all of that downloaded, you can run it. It will create a file called `audio.mp3` in the same directory, so just be aware of that.
