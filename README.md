# Discord-Music-Bot-via-Pytube

A simple Discord bot that plays music from YouTube in the voice channels. 

This bot is in very early development, so any help is greatly appreciated. 

I'd you want to try the bot out yourself, you need to download python, pytube, ffmpeg, discord.py, and the main.py file. After you have all of that downloaded, you can run it. It will create a file called `audio.mp3` in the same directory you put it in, so just be aware of that.

## Features: 

-Queue system

-bot play command to play any YouTube video in your Discord VC. 

-bot now playing command to know what is playing. 

-bot join command to allow the bot to Join the VC (although it will automatically join when you ask it to play)

-bot leave command to allow the bot to leave the VC (It will automatically leave when nothing is played for 2 minutes)

-bot stop to stop the music.

-bot skip to skip the song.
